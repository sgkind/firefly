* ownership
ownership rules:
+ Each value in Rust has an owner.
+ There can only be one owner at a time.
+ When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
* 引用
关于引用：
+ At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
+ References must always be valid.
