### 生命周期

One lifetime annotation by itself doesn’t have much meaning, because the annotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to each other.



### The elision rules

1. each parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter.
2. there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.
3. there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.
